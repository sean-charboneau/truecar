=======
  Assuming you have the standard Python libraries installed, you should just be able to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the requirements installed.  It is recommended to do this in a virtualenv to keep dependencies separate.
  
  You should then be able to start the app by running `python app.py`.  The app will run locally on `0.0.0.0:5000`.
  
  The app has also been deployed to a Heroku server.  You can access this at `http://truecar.herokuapp.com/`.

improvements
============
  There are any number of improvements/enhancements that could be made to make the app more powerful and user-friendly.  Some examples are:
  
  -An admin page where the database can be updated with new entries
  
  -Pull down pictures of the car in question
  
  -Add support for different VSN styles, or expanded information on those makes/models
